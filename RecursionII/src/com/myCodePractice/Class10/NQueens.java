/*Description
        Get all valid ways of putting N Queens on an N * N chessboard so that no two Queens threaten each other.

        Assumptions

        N > 0
        Return

        A list of ways of putting the N Queens
        Each way is represented by a list of the Queen's y index for x indices of 0 to (N - 1)
        Example

        N = 4, there are two ways of putting 4 queens:

        [1, 3, 0, 2] --> the Queen on the first row is at y index 1, the Queen on the second row is at y index 3, the Queen on the third row is at y index 0 and the Queen on the fourth row is at y index 2.

        [2, 0, 3, 1] --> the Queen on the first row is at y index 2, the Queen on the second row is at y index 0, the Queen on the third row is at y index 3 and the Queen on the fourth row is at y index 1.
