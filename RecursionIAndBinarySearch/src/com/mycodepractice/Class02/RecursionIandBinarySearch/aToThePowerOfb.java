/*Description
        Evaluate a to the power of b, assuming both a and b are integers and b is non-negative.

        Examples

        power(2, 0) = 1
        power(2, 3) = 8
        power(0, 10) = 0
        power(-2, 5) = -32
        Corner Cases

        What if the result is overflowed? We can assume the result will not be overflowed when we solve this problem on this online judge.*/
