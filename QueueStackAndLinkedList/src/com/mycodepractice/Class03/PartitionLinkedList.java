/*Description
        Given a linked list and a target value T, partition it such that all nodes less than T are listed before the nodes larger than or equal to target value T. The original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions should be preserved.

        Examples

        L = 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> null, T = 3, is partitioned to 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> null*/
public class PartitionLinkedList {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int target) {
