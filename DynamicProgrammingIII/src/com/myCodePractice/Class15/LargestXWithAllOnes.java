Description
Given a matrix that contains only 1s and 0s, find the largest X shape which contains only 1s, with the same arm lengths and the four arms joining at the central point.

Return the arm length of the largest X shape.

Assumptions

The given matrix is not null, has size of N * M, N >= 0 and M >= 0.
Examples

{ {0, 0, 0, 0},

  {1, 1, 1, 1},

  {0, 1, 1, 1},

  {1, 0, 1, 1} }

the largest X of 1s has arm length 2.
