/*Description
        Given an unlimited flow of numbers, keep track of the median of all elements seen so far.

        You will have to implement the following two methods for the class

read(int value) - read one value from the flow
        median() - return the median at any time, return null if there is no value read so far
        Examples

        read(1), median is 1
        read(2), median is 1.5
        read(3), median is 2
        read(10), median is 2.5
